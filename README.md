## About the app

This is a project from [Jonas Schmedtmann's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) I took. I didn't deploy this app, but if you want to run it, please read below.

## How to use (if you are curious)

1. Clone or download
1. Run `npm i`
1. `npm start` to start the live local server for the react app
1. `npm run server` to start the fake api
